## Development and Support

**Habitat-Mapper** was developed by the [Hakai Institute](https://hakai.org), a marine research organization based in
British Columbia, Canada. The Hakai Institute led the development of this software package and contributed the majority
of machine learning training data used to build the kelp detection and mussel and gooseneck barnacle detection models.

## Training Data Contributors

### The Nature Conservancy of California

[The Nature Conservancy of California](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/california/)
generously provided drone-based kelp imagery that was used to help train the kelp detection models. This high-resolution
aerial data was instrumental in improving model accuracy and robustness.

### Dr. Katherine Cavanaugh

[Dr. Cavanaugh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Luu6YqYAAAAJ&hl=en) contributed valuable model development
experience as well as expert annotations of Planet Labs satellite imagery that were used to help train the
**kelp-ps8b** model. These expert annotations helped enable kelp detection capabilities for PlanetScope 8-band imagery.
