# Installation and Updating

The library is currently available for Python versions 3.9 through 3.11. Support for
future versions
will be added when possible.

New versions of the tool are occasionally released to improve segmentation performance,
speed, and the user interface of the tool. Changes are published to the PyPI and
Anaconda repositories using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). You may want to
occasionally run the update commands to ensure that you're using the most up-to-date
version of `kelp-o-matic`.
