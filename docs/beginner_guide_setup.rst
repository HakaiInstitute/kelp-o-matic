Install Packages
----------------

Next you will install the “hakai-segmentation” package in your environment.

In the Anaconda Navigator with your environment selected and “Not Installed” selected in the drop down menu, type “hakai-segmentation” in the search packages search bar.

..  image:: ./images/install_packages2.png
    :width: 100%

Type “hakai-segmentation” in the search packages search bar. This is the name of the package you are installing (make sure it is spelled correctly).

..  image:: ./images/install_packages3.png
    :width: 100%

Click the box beside “hakai-segmentation” and then click Apply to install the package.

..  image:: ./images/install_packages4.png
    :width: 100%

A dialogue box will appear and ask you to install packages, click the apply button.

..  image:: ./images/install_packages5.png
    :width: 100%

Now when you select Installed on the drop-down menu the “hakai-segmentation” package should appear.

**Part 1 set-up is now complete!**

You are now ready to run the Hakai-Segmention tool. Once completed, the set-up steps will not have to be repeated on your computer.
