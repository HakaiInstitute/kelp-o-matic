The most reliable way to install ``kelp-o-matic`` is with `Conda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/>`_.

becomes possible.


Conda
-----

Use the Anaconda Navigator GUI to create a new environment and add the *hakai-institute*, and *conda-forge* channels
before searching for and installing the ``kelp-o-matic`` package in your environment.

Alternatively, install using your terminal or the Anaconda prompt (for Windows users) by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge -c hakai-institute kelp-o-matic

.. warning:: It is highly recommended to install the library with Conda, not with PIP.

You can install ``kelp-o-matic`` with PIP. Automatic hardware acceleration is only supported with the Conda install.
